00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.000
My name is Tokio

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but when this story began

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.000
that wasn't my name

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
[Screaming] don't move or I'll blow you in half!

5
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.000
- How about stealing about 2.4 billion euros?

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.500
[Dramatic music]

7
00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.000
[On the phone] Mom? I'm thinking of going on a trip.

[Music starts] 

9
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500
No one has ever hit that hard

10
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
not even in New York, London or Monte Carlo.

11
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So if my picture needs to be in the news again,
at least it'll be for the greatest heist in history

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Every family in this country will be asking 

13
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"what are they doing now?"

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
What are we robbing?

What are we robbing?

19
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The Royal Mint of Spain

20
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's absolutely imperative that the police
have no idea what we're doing.

21
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You have to be very careful, because

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the second anyone's blood is shed
we'll no longer be Robin Hood

23
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but just a bunch of plain of motherfucking killers

24
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
[Screams]

25
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's time, so just trust us and obey.

26
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But all that peace was only
the calm before the storm.

27
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Things were about to get so fucked up

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.500
that we came very close to losing it all.

29
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Music plays]

30
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Thief.

31
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Murderer.

32
