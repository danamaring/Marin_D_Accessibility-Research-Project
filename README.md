# A/V ACCESSIBILITY RESEARCH PROJECT
## Authoring 4 - Media for everyone.
'Media for everyone' is a research project designed to learn the basic elements of an accessible website and how to display accessible media elements on it. Some of the main features that were taken care of are interactive and static captions for every video and audio element, special attention to the contrast levels used and buttons to help the user skip the secondary content.
